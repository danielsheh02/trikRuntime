/// is highly asynchronous due to use of wpa_supplicant, which uses asynchronous
/// message passing to communicate with client software.
/// 1. Upon construction widget requests status from WiFi controller.
/// 2. Upon construction widget requests scan from WiFi controller (so every
/// time this widget is opened it will
///    ask WiFi controller to rescan networks, no "Rescan" button is needed).
/// 3. On status response it shows IP address and connection status.
/// 4. On Scan response it refreshes list of available networks (and shows them
/// instead of "Scanning..." message). It
///    also clears internal network info model and repopulates it with new
///    information.
/// 5. On selecting new network in a network list widget moves to "connecting"
/// state and then tries to connect.
/// 6. After "connect" request widget expects "disconnected" signal and then
/// "connected" signal.
///    6.1. Planned "disconnected" signal is ignored since widget is already in
///    "connecting" state. 6.2. "connected" signal moves widget to "connected"
///    state and causes to refresh ip address and connection status
///         indication.
///    6.3. If widget does not receive "connected" signal in time, it will move
///    to "errored" state (with proper
///         indication).
/// 7. If a widget gets unplanned "disconnect" signal from WiFi controller, it
/// will move to "notConnected" state and
///    initiate network scan.
/// 8. Receiving "scanFinished" signal will cause widget to refresh available
/// networks list.
/// 9. It is possible to receive unplanned "connected" signal, widget will
/// update connection information accordingly.
